## üîç Workshop Overview
This 10-day hands-on workshop focused on advanced TCL scripting for automation in Synthesis, Physical Design, and STA. Topics included TCL basics, constraints<br> parsing, memory module synthesis using Yosys, and QoR analysis. Designed for students and professionals, the workshop offered practical labs and concluded with an<br> industry-grade certification from VSD.<br>

### Day 1 Theory 
In this workshop, we are working on a task that involves creating a TCL script-based tool (TCL box). This tool takes a CSV file as input and processes it to generate timing analysis results, as illustrated in the figure below :-

The flow to create the TCL toolbox is as below :-

[Subtask] is to pass the following csv file as input 
![1p4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70aa13e3-3319-4118-9a94-0a90dd18b3d3)
[Subtask] Convert csv to format[1] (which is input1 to yosys)
![1p6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28baaa98-b01d-4cc8-9192-56fd0495c673)
[Subtask] Convert design constraint file to sdc (which is input2 to yosys)
![1p8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cbd1f6c-0425-40b1-bee2-0f398e0e3ad1)
[SubTask] Convert the previous outputs to format[2] (which is input to timing tool)

### Day 1 Lab
Creating a shell script cover which will take the input as csv & pass it to tcl script 
Case 1 : when user doesnt not provide any aruguments 
![1p14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff84a39-8553-45f0-80f6-7e44d07b9a40)
![1p15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8851c9a9-e948-491e-90ac-cb0a4876961f)
Case 2 : when user provides the wrong csv file as input 
![1p16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78524af7-3809-43a7-93e0-27d3747923b6)
![1p17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d880f0-4da0-4505-9a41-1ac56d855a77)
Case 3 : when user provides correct csv , the csv contents are stored in variables
