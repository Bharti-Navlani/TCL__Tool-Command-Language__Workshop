### üß± [Day 1]
In this workshop, we are working on a task that involves creating a TCL script-based tool (TCL box). This tool takes a CSV file as input and processes it to generate timing analysis results, as illustrated in the figure below :- 

![1p1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af8aa8a8-873e-4bc8-b48e-b614e05807e9)

The flow to create the TCL toolbox is as below :-<br>

üìå [Quick Notes]

grep -v -w "*" // print everything removing *

string map <searc> <replace> $line // command to search & replace 

proc // any script which needs to called multiple time can be created as proc

$args - options(-localCpu) // use to sub args in a give input

file dirname $argv // input is file path , this gives the directory name of that file

fail tale $agrv // input is a file path , this gives the file name

## üìù Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Mr. Kunal Ghosh and the VSD (VLSI System Design) team for organizing the TCL workshop and making the learning material accessible in a clear and structured manner. The course offered clear explanations and practical insights that contributed meaningfully to my understanding of the subject.
